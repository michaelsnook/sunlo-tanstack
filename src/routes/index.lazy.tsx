							The Story Behind Sunlo
						</CardTitle>
					</CardHeader>
					<CardContent>
						<div className="columns-1 space-y-4 text-xl/8 @lg:columns-2">
							<p>
								Sunlo is a labour of love that started in 2015 when I came to
								India and found tools like the owl app lacking. (You know the
								one...)
							</p>
							<p>
								I found I didn&apos;t need to know the word for
								&ldquo;Tomato&rdquo; as much as I needed to be able to point at
								the tomato and say &ldquo;give me 6 of those (polite).&rdquo;
								When I learned to do this, the rest started to fall into place.
							</p>
							<p>
								As I tried other methods and researched the science of
								language-learning I started to feel a lack of good tools for
								helping people learn languages that are{' '}
								<em>different in structure</em> from the ones they&apos;re
								raised on. Learning{' '}
								<span className="underline decoration-accent decoration-[3px]">
									Spanish
								</span>{' '}
								from{' '}
								<span className="underline decoration-accent decoration-[3px]">
									English
								</span>{' '}
								may be straight-forward with lessons on vocabulary and grammar,
								but the same approach might not work to learn{' '}
								<span className="underline decoration-accent decoration-[3px]">
									Arabic
								</span>
								,{' '}
								<span className="underline decoration-accent decoration-[3px]">
									Xhosa
								</span>{' '}
								or{' '}
								<span className="underline decoration-accent decoration-[3px]">
									Mandarin
								</span>
								, whose grammars and patterns may be too unfamiliar for me to
								succeed with that formulaic approach.
							</p>
							<p>
								The answer to this problem seems to be a phrase-based approach,
								where you don&apos;t necessarily try to understand every meaning
								and tense, you learn <em>chunks of meaning</em> that you can use
								in real life. And when you do, it creates a reward in your brain
								and helps you connect with others in your world, both of which
								aid in the formation of lasting, usable memory.
							</p>
							<p>
								There&apos;s a fantastic (and free) app called Anki – which I
								also use and love! – which takes this phrase-based approach, and{' '}
								<a
									className="s-link"
									href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/background.html"
								>
									their background doc
								</a>{' '}
								does a great job of explaining why it&apos;s so effective.{' '}
							</p>
							<p>
								But the most important part of my learning journey was the
								friends I made who were excited to help me. There are a couple
								of friends who have an intuitive sense of how much I know and
								don&apos;t know, and are able to speak to me in a way that they
								know I&apos;ll understand enough of what they&apos;re saying
								that I can learn and figure out the rest.
							</p>
							<p>
								So Sunlo is a bit of a love song to those friends – the very
								reason we learn in the first place – to make them main
								characters in the play as well. It invites them to help curate
								your deck of flash cards and find or create the ones they think
								you&apos;ll need and use and love. If you&apos;re a friend
								helping a newcomer learn your language – Sunlo is for you too.
								Thank you, and welcome! I hope you love it.
