ISSUES
1. auth guard is always redirecting to login and back

RADIX
1. ✅ replace the DaisyUI expandos
		tweak it so you can click without open-close (no bubble)

PRIMARY CARD INTERACTIONS
1. bring over the new structure for relations
1. make the "add to deck" function work
1. bring over the "edit status"

AUTH
1. ✅ add AuthContext -- so far I've just mocked it with useQuery
1. ✅ add signOut action to AuthContext -- correction: mocked it with its own hook
1. ✅ figure out "redirect to home screen" on logout 
1. auth guard bounce, login, redirect back (only when not logged in)
1. @TODO in the _auth/login.tsx - why using hooks? we should have this already


NAVIGATION
1. ✅ get back the "active/inactive" link style in sidebar.tsx
1. properly use the disabled option on the nav links
1. ✅ probably set it to only active-match exact route matches
1. ✅ don't forget to add the Navbar
1. ✅ add context menus (links) to all the pages and scaffold pages

UX
1. Add activity graph to deck summaries :)) https://app.radicle.xyz/nodes/seed.radicle.xyz/rad:z4V1sjrXqjvFdnCUbxPFqd5p4DtH5/tree/src/components/ActivityDiagram.svelte
1. When a loader awaits, this is a time to show blank shell and transition in

BETTER FORMS
1. Try Zod https://v0.dev/chat/cddhdPsiX7x (this ex is for login form inputs)
1. Try react-formal https://jquense.github.io/react-formal/getting-started/

DATA LOADING
1. ✅ replace useLang with router feature
1. ✅ replace the old useProfile and ProfileFull
1. ✅ refresh all the fetcher hooks w the select-paradigm code
1. research loaders, preloading, query client prefetching, etc. patterns so
		we can get the most out of things. 
		* access `auth` on first render inside the DaisyUI
		* suspend until profile loads
		* suspend /$lang routes until language & deck load
		* when the router loader is suspending and then stops, transition in
1. don't use `enabled` to waterfall useQueries on auth context
		perhaps this will just be a code convention only render components after auth
		perhaps there is a better way to use the params / data / keys

CROSS-PLATFORM
1. ✅ compile to android with tauri
 		Make Tauri work with HMR and Vite setup
1. compile to ios with tauri
